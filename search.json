    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nYearly recruitment (\\(R\\)), the number of young individuals that enter the population every year, and annual natural mortality (\\(M\\)), expressing the fraction of the population dying each year from any non-fishing causes (e.g. disease, competition, predation, etc.) are key parameters in population dynamics models.\nDue to challenges in obtaining reliable estimates of krill biomass (and hence numbers) at recruitment, standard krill recruitment modelling is instead based on the proportion of recruits in the population. This method, commonly known as the Proportional Recruitment (PR) model, was firstly proposed by de de la Mare (1994) and later expanded by Pavez et al. (2021).\nUsing the mean and variance of the proportion of recruits estimated from independent surveys, the PR model derives the recruitment variability (expressed as a coefficient of variance, \\(CV_R\\)) and natural mortality of the population. Estimated values of \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\) can subsequently be used to generate series of \\(R\\) that follow the underlying distribution of proportion of recruits (or, specifically, the odds of recruits).\nAdditionally, as PR estimates are obtained from a finite number of surveys, the PR framework also provides alternative methods to convey the uncertainty about the true values of parameters \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\). These methods involve generating random draws of \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\) via resampling-based techniques such as parametric bootstrap or inverse probability transform (Pavez et al. (2021)).\nIn this section we generate random draws of \\(CV_R\\) and \\(M\\) under different scenarios of proportional recruitment, which will be used in population model projections at later stages of the analysis. The PR analysis performed here is very similar to that applied in Maschette et al. (2021), with the exception that the proportion of recruits is assumed to be log-Normally distributed (as opposed to inverse-Beta).\nMany of the key functions used in this analysis are available in a CCAMLR’s code repository, which provides a base-case implementation of {GRYM} for the stock assessment of the Antarctic Krill."

(2021) and implemented in function prfit(), available from krill’s base-case code repository.\nAt each iteration, the PR model is fitted by determining the properties of the underlying distribution of odds of recruits (\\(Q\\)), which depend on both \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\), for a given set of random quantiles of the distribution of \\(Q\\). Values of parameters \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\) are adjusted to provide the best fit between model predictions and observed data in terms of mean and variance of recruitment proportion in surveys. The fitting process is repeated niter times with newly generated random quantiles, each time returning a single set of estimates (i.e. draws) of \\(M\\), \\(CV_R\\) and associated mean (\\(\\mu_Q\\)) and variance (\\(\\sigma^2_Q\\)) of odds of recruit.\n\nPrepare model and data for parallel computations\nParallelization is conducted at the iteration level, with each parallel node fitting one PR model at a time.

This is expected since higher natural mortality rates lead to a rapid decline of numbers in older age-classes, making the proportion of recruits in the population more prominent. The opposite occurs when natural mortality is low.\nRegarding recruitment variability, the magnitude of drawn \\(CV_R\\) estimates is, unsurprisingly, correlated with to the variance in observed recruitment proportion under each scenario (see Table 1.1 for reference). Evidently, highly variable yearly recruitment will cause the fraction of recruits in the population to fluctuate from year to year.\nThe level of uncertainty about parameters \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\) for the considered scenarios is reflected by the spread of the generated draws, which is conveyed by the plots in Figure 1.1 and, relatedly, the standard deviation of draws presented in the table above. Results suggest that uncertainty is affected by the variability in recruitment and the number of surveys from which proportion of recruits are estimated (Table 1.1 for reference).\nSome further observations:\n\ndraws generated under the “Initial values” scenario are notably more condensed compared to the remaining scenarios. This indicates that the “Initial values” scenario has the lowest uncertainty about both \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\) parameters.\nDespite the estimated low variance in recruitment, uncertainty about \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\) under “Scenario 30” is larger than the “Initial values” scenario due to recruitment proportion estimates being calculated from only 3 surveys (as opposed to 17 under “Initial values”)\ndraws under “Scenario 6” and “Scenario 12” are similar, showing that combining data from two surveys (Table 1.1) do not make an impact on the estimation process.\nThe way in which the proportion of recruits in each survey is determined, such as how sample-level estimates are weighed and scaled (“Scenario 6” and “Scenario 12” Vs. “Scenario 18” and “Scenario 24”) or the chosen body length cutoff point (“Scenario 18” Vs “Scenario 24”), determines the magnitude of the estimates of \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\).\n\n\nReverse-check\nHere we simulate survey estimates of mean and variance of recruitment proportion from the PR model, for each of the considered scenarios. Recruitment series are generated from each draw of \\(M\\) and \\(CV_R\\), which are then used to simulate the proportion of recruits that would be seen in surveys. Thus, each draw generates a series of “observed” proportion of recruits from which estimates are calculated.\nThe core simulating function prSim() is provided in krill’s base case code repository.
