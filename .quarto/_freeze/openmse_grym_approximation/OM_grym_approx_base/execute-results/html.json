This choice of age-classes is based on the fact that krill is not expected to live long past 7 years, while krill younger than 1 year old are rarely seen in survey data (Maschette and Wotherspoon, 2021). Thus, under GRYM, krill is assumed to recruit to the modelled stock at age-1.\n\nUnder `{openMSE}`, **however**, the population dynamics model is structured as `maxage`+1 age classes, with recruitment modelled to occur at age-0. Currently `{openMSE}` does not offer the option to change the age of the first modelled age-class. \n\nAge of recruitment (0 vs 1) and number of age-classes (8 vs 7) assumed under each framework are therefore different.\n\n\n#### Length-at-age distribution\n\nGRYM does not account for variation in length-at-age, implying that all individuals follow exactly the average growth curve.\n\nTrial runs in `{openMSE}` showed simulations crashing if variation in length-at-age was set to zero. A minimum level of variation in length-at-age was used. \n\n**Note**: some warning messages are shown during simulations when low variation in length-at-age is assumed. For the purpose of the approximation to GRYM, these warnings can be ignored.\n\n\n#### Historical period\n\nIn GRYM, stock projections start from a pre-exploitation state, ignoring information on historical and current status of the fishery. This option is not available in `{openMSE}`, as it enforces the simulation of an historical period of length `nyears` leading up to a current state, from which the stock projected forward by applying each MP under evaluation. Trial runs showed that the MSE simulation crashes when `nyears` is less than 5 years.\n\nTo approximate `{openMSE}` to GRYM, depletion optimization parameter `D` was set to 1 and fishing effort parameters were fixed to zero to define an historical period of 5 years with no fishing mortality. So, in relation to GRYM, MSE simulations have an additional lead-up period of 5 years before fishing mortality under each gamma value (expressed as an MP) is applied to stock projections.\n\n<!-- **Note**: MSE's optimization of stock and fisheries dynamics to the chosen `D` is not expected to provide values of SSB at the end of the historical period that ate equal to SSB0. -->\n\n\n#### Annual Recruitment\n\nGRYM projections do not account for strict stock-recruitment relationships, i.e. the strength of annual recruitments are **mostly** assumed to be independent of precedent levels of spawning stock biomass. Annual numbers of recruits are at first simulated by generating random deviates from a mean recruitment of 1 and variance estimated from the variability in the proportion of recruits observed in multiple surveys (Maschette and Wotherspoon, 2021). This is called the Proportional Recruitment (PR) method (Pavez et al., 2021). However, GRYM imposes a constraint on the level of recruitment if the population is depleted, in which case the simulated value of recruitment value is multiplied the proportion of current SSB below the depletion level ($SSB/(0.2 \\times SSB0)$).\n\n`{openMSE}` relies on a strict stock-recruitment relationship and so there appears to be no option for constraining recruitment strength based on the level of depletion. In fact, by assuming steepness of 1, `{openMSE}` further deviates from GRYM when simulated populations fall below depletion levels.\n\n\n# Custom Parameters\n\n## `M` and `Perr`\n\nSpecific simulation values used for Natural Mortality (**M**) and recruitment variability (**Perr**), both from as random draws of `M` and coefficient of variation of recruitment (`R_CV`) obtained from the Proportional Recruitment (PR) model currently applied to Krill under GRYM assessments (Pavez et al, 2021).\n\nFor this `OM`, simulated values of `M` and `R_CV` were generated using PR inputs provided in Maschette et al (2021), specifically those identified as \"initial parameters\", i.e.:\n  - Mean proportional recruitment: 0.5570\n  - SD of proportional recruitment: 0.126\n  - Nr. of surveys: 17\n  - Reference age-class: 2\n\nObtained draws `R_CV` were converted to log-normal standard deviations ($SD = \\sqrt{log(CV^2 + 1)}$) and plugged in as simulation values of `Perr`. \n\nNote: `{openMSE}` seems to simulate recruitments as $R_y = \\mu_R \\times d_R,  d_R \\sim logN \\left( \\frac{\\texttt{-Perr}^2}{2}, \\texttt{Perr}^2 \\right)$\n\n## Age-plus group\n\nFrom code provided in [GYM's base case for krill](https://github.com/ccamlr/Grym_Base_Case/tree/Simulations), population dynamics functions (e.g. `Grym::ageStructureS`) are run with argument `plus = FALSE`., i.e. the final age-class is not treated as an age-plus class. \n\n`{openMSE}` defaults to use the maximum age-class `maxage` as a plus group. So, to approximate to Krill's base case, the plus group needs to be switched off by setting the custom parameter `OM@cpars$plusgroup=0`.\n\n\n# Stock Parameters\n\n## maxage\n\nMaximum age chosen for consistency with GRYM's application (Maschette et al.,\n2021), where the final age-class covers ages 7 - 8.\n\nIn addition, as explained in section [Custom Parameters](#age-plus-group) above,\nage-class 8 **is not** an age-plus group.\n\n\n## R0\n\nAdopting same value as the mean recruitment assumed in krill assessment under GRYM.\n\n\n## M\n\nSimulation values for `M` provided in cpars (see [Custom\nParameters](#custom-parameters)). The text above about `M` being drawn from an\nuniform distribution should be ignored.\n\n\n## Msd\n\nSimilarly to Krill's GRYM application, assuming natural mortality is constant\nover time.\n\n\n## h\n\nStudies have failed to show a strong correlation between spawning biomass and\nsubsequent recruitment in krill populations (Siegel and Loeb, 1995; Kinzey et\nal., 2019). This is mainly due to large inter-annual variability in biomass of\nspawners and recruits, which are thought to be strongly driven by environmental\nfactors.\n\nGRYM projections do not account for stock-recruitment relationships, instead\nsimulating annual recruitment by sampling from a probability distribution with mean and\nvariance estimated from recruitment levels observed in acoustic surveys (check\nSection [Annual Recruitment](#annual-recruitment) for more details).\n\n`{openMSE}` does not offer the option to simulate recruits from a user-defined\nsampling distribution. Instead, mean recruitments $\\mu_R$ are calculated from a\nstock-recruitment relationship defined by steepness `h`, which are in turn used\nto generate annual numbers of recruits $R_y$ from recruitment deviations $d_R$\nfollowing a lognormal process error, i.e. (?):\n\n$$R_y = \\mu_R \\times d_R,  d_R \\sim logN \\left( -\\frac{\\texttt{Perr}^2}{2}, \\texttt{Perr}^2 \\right)$$\nif correlation in recruitments between consecutive years is ignored.\n\nThus, fixing `h = 1` (i.e. forcing stock-recruitment independence) and using the\nrecruitment variance estimates from PR as `Perr` inputs should provide a good\napproximation of  `{openMSE}` to GRYM in terms of recruitment simulation. \n\nNote: assuming `h = 1` implies high resilience of the population to\nstrong harvesting, presenting a high probability of rebuilding when fishing\npressure is relaxed even at low stock sizes.\n\n\n## SRrel\n\nBeverton–Holt model, to force stock-recruitment independence for `h = 1`. The Ricker\nmodel imposes a density dependence in the stock-recruitment process regardless\nof the value `h`.\n\n\n## Perr\n\nSimulation values for `Perr` provided in cpars (see [Custom\nParameters](#custom-parameters)). The text above about values being drawn from\nan uniform distribution should be ignored.\n\n\n## AC\n\nAssuming no autocorrelation between consecutive annual recruitments, i.e.\nfollowing the same approach as Krill's GRYM base case.\n\n\n## Linf\n\n$L_\\infty$ parameter assumed as known (i.e. no uncertainty), as in GRYM. Same\n$L_\\infty$ value (mm) as used in Maschette et al. (2021) analysis, which cite\nConstable and de la Mare (1996).\n\n\n## Linfsd\n\nAs in GRYM, assuming no inter-annual variation in $L_\\infty$.\n\n\n## K\n\nGrowth parameter $K$ assumed as known (i.e. no uncertainty), as in GRYM. Same\n$K$ as used in Maschette et al. (2021) analysis, which cite Thanassekos et al\n(2021).\n\n\n## Ksd\n\nAs in GRYM, assuming no inter-annual variation in in growth parameter $K$. \n\n\n## t0\n\nAge at size-0 assumed as known (i.e. no uncertainty), as in GRYM. Same parameter\nvalue as used in Maschette et al. (2021) analysis, which cite Thanassekos et al\n(2021).\n\n\n## LenCV\n\nAssuming low variation in length-at-age - see Section [Length-at-age\ndistribution](#length-at-age-distribution) above. Also, variation in\nlength-at-age treated as known (i.e. no uncertainty and hence fixed across\nsimulations).\n\n\n## L50\n\nSame values as Min and Max length (mm) at 50% maturity used in Maschette et al.\n(2021) analysis - specifically the 'initial values' used for size at maturity.\n\n\n## L50_95\n\nGRYM formulates size-at-maturity using the ogive ramp function specified in terms\n`L50` and the ramp's width `w` (i.e. the range at which maturity occurs). \n\nThus, `L95` (length at which 95% of individuals are matures) can be derived via\nthe quantile function of the uniform distribution with limits `L50 +- w/2`. For\na (known) width of 6mm, used as 'initial value' in Maschette et al (2021), we get the\nrequired `L50_95` parameter value.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nw <- 6\nL50 <- 35 # arbitrary as `w` is treated as independent of L50 in Maschette et al (2021)\nL95 <- qunif(0.95, L50 - w/2, L50 + w/2)\nL95 - L50 \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2.7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nSimilarly to GRYM, where `w` is treated as known, `L50_95` is also kept fixed\nacross simulations.\n\n\n## D\n\nRange of values indicating growing population, i.e. making SSB in the last\nhistorical year to be higher than SSB0. Given that we are imposing absence of\nfishing mortality in historical period via the parameters `EffLower` and\n`EffUpper`, values assigned to parameter `D` should be irrelevant in terms of\ndepletion due to fishing. In this case, and for a given level of constant\nnatural mortality, depletion level is simply reflecting changes in biomass due\nto variability in annual recruitment.\n\n*Note 1*: Trial runs tested setting up an unexploited historical period via the `cpars`\noption, by providing a 0-filled matrix `cpars$Find`. `cpars$qs` values were also\nprovided to skip the depletion optimization process. Unfortunately, and for no\nclear reason, MSE simulations crashed at the projection phase.\n\n*Note 2*: Ideally it would be desirable to set the length of the historical period\nto zero, but that also does not seem possible under the current `{openMSE}`\nversion. See more details in section [Historical period](#historical-period) above.\n\n\n\n## a\n\nSame estimate as that specified in Maschette et al. (2021) for the 'initial'\nweight-at-length relationship (via the power law, W = a * Lb). Note: units of\nweight and length are, respectively, grams and millimeters.\n\n\n## b\n\nSame estimate as that specified in Maschette et al. (2021) for the 'initial'\nweight-at-length relationship. \n\n\n\n## Size_area_1\n\nParameter value not allowed to be 1 (i.e. forcing one single area), so defining two\nsub-areas of equal size.\n\n\n## Frac_area_1\n\nParameter value not allowed to be 1 (i.e. forcing whole population in a single\narea), so specifying that population is evenly split between the two sub-areas.\n\n\n## Prob_staying\n\nAssuming 50/50 chance of movement between sub-areas.\n\n\n\n\n## Fdisc\n\nArbitrary values, as discards are assumed non-existent, similarly to GRYM.\n\n\n\n## Source\nNo justification provided. \n\n\n\n# Fleet Parameters\n\n## nyears\n\nMinimum allowed number of years for historical period.

Effort in the provided year will be null.\n\n## EffLower\n\nPopulation assumed to remain unexploited during the historical period.\n\n\n## EffUpper\n\nPopulation assumed to remain unexploited during the historical period.\n\n\n## Esd\n\nPopulation assumed to remain unexploited during the historical period, so\nvariability in historical fishing mortality is ignored.\n\n## qinc\n\nAnalogously to GRYM, assuming no change in gear efficiency over the projection years.\n\n\n## qcv\n\nAnalogously to GRYM, assuming constant gear catchability over the projection years.\n\n\n## L5\n\nSimilarly to the maturity ogive, gear selectivity in `{GRYM}` is specified via a\nramp function defined by two parameters: (i) `L50`, the length at which there is 50%\nretention probability for a given individual; and (ii) `SR`, the selection range.\n\nMinimum and maximum values of `L50` and `SR` from Thanassekos et al (2021, *in*\nMaschette et al., 2021), which are used to derive min and max values of `L5` via\nthe quantile function.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nSR <- 11\nL50 <- c(30, 35)\nL5 <- qunif(0.05, L50 - SR/2, L50 + SR/2)\nL5\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 25.05 30.05\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## LFS\n\nValues derived from `L50` and `SR` from Thanassekos et al (2021), as above.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nL50 + SR/2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 35.5 40.5\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Vmaxlen\n\nAll individuals considered to be selected at $L_{\\infty}$, i.e. selectivity\nassumed to be logistic.\n\n## isRel\n\nSelectivity parameters are in absolute units.\n\n\n## LR5\n\nAnalogously to GRYM, assuming no discards - i.e. all individuals selected by the\ngear are retained.\n\n\n\n## LFR\n\nAnalogously to GRYM, assuming no discards - i.e. all individuals selected by the\ngear are retained.\n\n\n## Rmaxlen\n\nSame as `Vmaxlen`, i.e. 100% of fish are retained at $L_{\\infty}$.\n\n\n## DR\n\nAssuming no discards.\n\n## CurrentYr\nFinal year with available data.\n\n\n## MPA\n\nStock assumed to be constrained to one single area. \n\n\n\n\n# Obs Parameters\n\nThis section is mostly irrelevant for this comparison with GRYM, as specified\nMPs (one for each level of harvest rate 'gamma') don't require observed/sampled\ndata from the fishery.\n\n## Cobs\n\nCatch assumed known without observation error.\n\n\n## Cbiascv\n\nCatch assumed known without observation bias.\n\n\n## CAA_nsamp\n\nNo catch-at-age sampling.\n\n## CAA_ESS\n\nNo catch-at-age sampling.\n\n\n## CAL_nsamp\n\nNo catch-at-length sampling.\n\n## CAL_ESS\n\nNo catch-at-length sampling.\n\n\n## Iobs\n\nNo observation error in the relative abundance index.\n\n## Btobs\n\nNo observation error in the absolute abundance index.\n\n## Btbiascv\n\nNo bias in observations of stock biomass.\n\n## beta\n\nAssuming no hyperstability/hyperdepletion in abundance estimation.\n\n\n## LenMbiascv\nAssuming no bias in estimated biological parameters.\n\n## Mbiascv\nAssuming no bias in estimated biological parameters.\n\n## Kbiascv\nAssuming no bias in estimated biological parameters.\n\n## t0biascv\nAssuming no bias in estimated biological parameters.\n\n## Linfbiascv\nAssuming no bias in estimated biological parameters.\n\n## LFCbiascv\nAssuming no bias in estimated biological parameters.\n\n## LFSbiascv\nAssuming no bias in estimated biological parameters.\n\n## FMSY_Mbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## BMSY_B0biascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## Irefbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## Brefbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## Crefbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## Dbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## Dobs\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## hbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## Recbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## sigmaRbiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n## Eobs\nNo observation error around the total effort\n\n## Ebiascv\nAssuming no bias.\n\n# Imp Parameters\n\n## TACFrac\nBorrowed from: Perfect_Imp\n\n## TACSD\nBorrowed from: Perfect_Imp\n\n## TAEFrac\nBorrowed from: Perfect_Imp\n\n## TAESD\nBorrowed from: Perfect_Imp\n\n## SizeLimFrac\nBorrowed from: Perfect_Imp\n\n## SizeLimSD\nBorrowed from: Perfect_Imp\n\n\n\n# References\n\nConstable, A.J., de la Mare, W.K., 1996.
