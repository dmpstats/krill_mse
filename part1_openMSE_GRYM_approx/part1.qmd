- Main goal

  - why 5 PR scenarios? R and M are the two key sources of uncertainty modelled in GRYM (confirm this).
  Maschette et al showed that the choice of PR scenarios had the greatast impact
  on the estimated gammas. Uncertainty in these pars is estimated from PR model

- Analysis steps
  - Recruitment section (i.e. how recruitment is modeled under each approach)
- out-of-the-box deviations between frameworks (or dedicated chapter?)
- executive summary (?)
