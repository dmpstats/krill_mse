title: "Approximating openMSE/DLMTool to GRYM"
editor: source
---

- Main goal

  - Demonstrate that the `{openMSE}` framework, along with its primary package
  `{DLMTool}`, is a suitable and effective tool for conducting management
  strategy evaluation analysis for the Antarctic Krill stock. 
   
- Analysis outline

  - We use the powerful and highly customisable features of the `{DLMTool}` package
  to approximate the methodological approach currently used for the management
  of the krill fishery, which is based on the Generalised Yield Model (GYM) and
  implemented in `{GRYM}` package.
  
  - We compare results from population simulations conducted under both frameworks 
  for five different Proportional Recruitment scenarios.
  
    - why 5 PR scenarios? R and M are the two key sources of uncertainty modelled
  in GRYM (confirm this). Maschette et al showed that the choice of PR scenarios
  had the greatest impact on the estimated gammas. Uncertainty in these pars is
  estimated from PR model


- Out-of-the-box differences between frameworks

  - e.g. how recruitment is modeled under each approach

- executive summary (?)
