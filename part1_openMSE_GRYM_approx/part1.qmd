title: "Approximating openMSE/DLMTool to GRYM"

- Main goal

  - Demonstrate that the `{openMSE}` framework, along with its primary package
  `{DLMTool}`, is a suitable and effective tool for conducting management
  strategy evaluation analysis for the Antarctic Krill stock. 
   
- Analysis outline

  - We use the powerful and highly customisable features of the `{DLMTool}` package
  to approximate the methodological approach currently used for the management
  of the krill fishery, which is based on the Generalised Yield Model (GYM) and
  implemented in `{GRYM}` package.
  
  - We compare results from population simulations conducted under both frameworks 
  for five different Proportional Recruitment scenarios.
  
    - why 5 PR scenarios? R and M are the two key sources of uncertainty modelled
  in GRYM (confirm this). Maschette et al showed that the choice of PR scenarios
  had the greatest impact on the estimated gammas. Uncertainty in these pars is
  estimated from PR model


- Out-of-the-box differences between frameworks

  - e.g. how recruitment is modeled under each approach
  

- executive summary (?)






<!-- 

GRYM features not present in DLMTools that might cause deviations between the two
frameworks:

- GRYM is a daily-based age-structured model, i.e. population status and dynamics is
represented at a daily timesteps. This allows to model some of the population
characteristics (e.g. length@age, natural mortality, etc.) at a day-level, and
therefore allowing the specification of within-year patterns. DLMTool uses an
year-based age-structured model and so doesn't have the capacity to account for
within-year features in the population. Some specific examples:

  - fishing period & growth. As it stands, krill fishing season is assumed
  to spread across the whole year, so there is no real different to a year-step
  model. However, if fishing season is restricted to a given part of the year,
  then GRYM will account for the proportion of individuals that are selectable
  by the fishery given their size and growth during that period of year. In
  contrast, an year-step model applies the same fishing mortality to all
  individuals in that age-class
  
  - within-year growth pattern
  
  - within-year natural mortality pattern
  
  - SSB: GRYM computes SSB0 and SSB for a given period of the year (the
  spawning period). DLMTool considers SSB for a whole year. 
  
  - B0: GRYM applies harvest rate gamma to an estimate of B0 at a given time 
  period of the year (monitoring period), while DLMTool computes B0 for a whole given year.
