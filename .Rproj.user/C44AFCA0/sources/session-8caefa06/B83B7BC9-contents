## Introduction

Yearly recruitment ($R$), the number of young individuals that enter the population
every year, and annual natural mortality ($M$), expressing the fraction of the
population dying each year from any non-fishing causes (e.g. disease,
competition, predation, etc.) are key governing parameters in population
dynamics models.

Due to methodological challenges in obtaining reliable estimates of krill
biomass (and hence numbers) at recruitment, standard krill recruitment modelling
is instead based on estimates of the proportion of recruits in the population.
This method, commonly referred to as the Proportional Recruitment (PR) model,
was proposed by de @delamare94 and later expanded by @pavez_etal21.


<!-- This approach is part of the GRYM framework and was developed by de la mare and -->
<!-- subsequently expanded in pavez et al to address shortcomings in the way variability was being modelled. -->


<!-- The aim here is to generate random draws of recruitment variability (expressed as -->
<!-- coefficient of variance, $CV_R$) and annual natural mortality ($M$) parameters -->
<!-- under different scenarios of Proportional Recruitment (PR). -->


<!-- The six PR scenarios considered here are identical to those applied in -->
<!-- @maschette_etal21, where each scenario consists of a given set of input parameters -->

<!-- <!-- Simulated draws of $CV_R$ and $M$ are subsequently used  --> -->
<!-- <!-- the method currently used --> -->
<!-- <!-- in krill assessment to simulate annual recruitment whithin the GRYM. --> -->

<!-- consists of the mean a standard deviation -->
<!-- of proportional recruitment calculated from a different choice of research survey time-series, -->

<!-- For further -->


<!-- different combination of survey(s), time-series and -->

<!-- given survey time-series and/or recruitment length cut-off point -->


<!-- a subset of those applied in @maschette_etal21, -->
<!-- with each scenario consisting of proportional recruitment estimates obtained -->
<!-- from a different time-series of survey data. -->

<!-- PR scenarios considered -->


<!-- **Note**: GRYM defines recruitment as the number of individuals recruited *to -->
<!-- the fishery* (i.e. not to the whole population). Grym applications to krill -->
<!-- assume individuals recruit to the modeled stock fishery at age 1. -->


## Set-up

To generate values of $CV_R$ and $M$ from proportional recruitment estimates
under each scenario, we need to:

1. Define the within-year natural mortality structure

2. Choose the quantile function that defines the distribution of proportional
recruits

3. Provide the mean and variance estimates of the proportion of recruits seen
in the surveys, and the number of surveys conducted

4. Provide approximate estimates of $M$ and $CV_R$

5. Specify the number of parameter sets to generate


For the purpose of this analysis, we are only considering scenarios with
different PR estimates, i.e. 

. All the remaining GRYM parameters are fixed across
scenarios. For more details on the
