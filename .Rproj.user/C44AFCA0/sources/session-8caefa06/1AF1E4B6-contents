## Introduction

Yearly recruitment ($R$), the number of young individuals that enter the population
every year, and annual natural mortality ($M$), expressing the fraction of the
population dying each year from any non-fishing causes (e.g. disease,
competition, predation, etc.) are key governing parameters in population
dynamics models.

Due to methodological challenges in obtaining reliable estimates of krill
biomass (and hence numbers) at recruitment, standard krill recruitment modelling
is instead based on estimates of the proportion of recruits in the population.
This method, commonly referred to as the Proportional Recruitment (PR) model,
was proposed by de @delamare94 and later expanded by @pavez_etal21.
