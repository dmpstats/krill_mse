# Preface {.unnumbered}

*[Short intro on krill and its current management]*

The Antarctic krill fishery in FAO Area 48 is currently managed based on
precautionary catch limits set by the Commission for the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) and bla bla.

*[Role of MSE in fisheries]*


*[Main objectives]*

This analysis aspires to show how the tool `openMSE` can be applied to the Krill
fishery under a data-limited framework.


*[Main outline]*

The analysis is structured in two parts:

   - Part 1: Approximate `openMSE` to the current management approach
   
   - Part 2: Apply an example MSE to Krill

Maschette et al (2020):

SC-2019 (para. 3.16) noted the need to implement a revised management strategy that
would incorporate contemporary information across a range of spatial and temporal scales
to improve the likelihood of achieving CCAMLRâ€™s conservation objective for the krill fishery.
It also outlined a work plan and schedule for implementing the adopted strategy for krill
management (para. 3.34, Tables 1 and 2)
