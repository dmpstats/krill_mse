# Introduction



The management of the Antarctic Krill fishery is done by CCAMLR *bla bla bla*



This is an example of implementing the current krill fishery management strategy using the "umbrella" MSE package [`{openMSE}`](https://openmse.com/).



<!-- The Introduction section is used to briefly describe the fishery and the details of the Operating Model. -->

<!-- It should include an explanation for the OM parameters: -->

<!--  * nsim: the number of simulations. -->

<!--  * proyears: the number of projectio years. -->

<!--  * interval: the management interval. -->

<!--  * pstar: the percentile of the sample of the management recommendation for each method. -->

<!--  * maxF: the maximum instantaneous fishing mortality rate that may be simulated for any given age class. -->

<!--  * reps: the number of samples of the management recommendation for each method. -->







### Inherent differences between `{openMSE}` and `{Grym}` 



#### Starting age-class and age of recruitment



In GRYM's base application to krill, the stock is modelled using seven age-classes taking age-1 as the starting age-class, i.e. for age ranges 1-2, 2-3, ..., 6-7 and 7-8. This choice of age-classes is based on the fact that krill is not expected to live long past 7 years, while krill younger than 1 year old are rarely seen in survey data (Maschette and Wotherspoon, 2021). Thus, under GRYM, krill is assumed to recruit to the modelled stock at age-1.



Under `{openMSE}`, **however**, the population dynamics model is structured as `maxage`+1 age classes, with recruitment modelled to occur at age-0. Currently `{openMSE}` does not offer the option to change the age of the first modelled age-class. 



Age of recruitment (0 vs 1) and number of age-classes (8 vs 7) assumed under each framework are therefore different.





#### Length-at-age distribution



GRYM does not account for variation in length-at-age, implying that all individuals follow exactly the average growth curve.



Trial runs in `{openMSE}` showed simulations crashing if variation in length-at-age was set to zero. A minimum level of variation in length-at-age was used. 



**Note**: some warning messages are shown during simulations when low variation in length-at-age is assumed. For the purpose of the approximation to GRYM, these warnings can be ignored.





#### Historical period



In GRYM, stock projections start from a pre-exploitation state, ignoring information on historical and current status of the fishery. This option is not available in `{openMSE}`, as it enforces the simulation of an historical period of length `nyears` leading up to a current state, from which the stock projected forward by applying each MP under evaluation. Trial runs showed that the MSE simulation crashes when `nyears` is less than 5 years.



To approximate `{openMSE}` to GRYM, depletion optimization parameter `D` was set to 1 and fishing effort parameters were fixed to zero to define an historical period of 5 years with no fishing mortality. So, in relation to GRYM, MSE simulations have an additional lead-up period of 5 years before fishing mortality under each gamma value (expressed as an MP) is applied to stock projections.



<!-- **Note**: MSE's optimization of stock and fisheries dynamics to the chosen `D` is not expected to provide values of SSB at the end of the historical period that ate equal to SSB0. -->





#### Annual Recruitment



GRYM projections do not account for strict stock-recruitment relationships, i.e. the strength of annual recruitments are **mostly** assumed to be independent of precedent levels of spawning stock biomass. Annual numbers of recruits are at first simulated by generating random deviates from a mean recruitment of 1 and variance estimated from the variability in the proportion of recruits observed in multiple surveys (Maschette and Wotherspoon, 2021). This is called the Proportional Recruitment (PR) method (Pavez et al., 2021). However, GRYM imposes a constraint on the level of recruitment if the population is depleted, in which case the simulated value of recruitment value is multiplied the proportion of current SSB below the depletion level ($SSB/(0.2 \times SSB0)$).



`{openMSE}` relies on a strict stock-recruitment relationship and so there appears to be no option for constraining recruitment strength based on the level of depletion. In fact, by assuming steepness of 1, `{openMSE}` further deviates from GRYM when simulated populations fall below depletion levels.

# Stock Parameters 

### Mortality and age:  maxage, R0, M, Msd

**maxage**: The maximum age of individuals that is simulated. There are maxage+1 (recruitment to age-0) age classes in the storage matrices. maxage is the plus group where all age-classes > maxage are grouped, unless option switched off with OM@cpars$plusgroup=0 . Single value. Positive integer.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 8</span>



Maximum age chosen for consistency with GRYM's application (Maschette et al., 
2021), where the final age-class covers ages 7 - 8. 


In addition, as explained in section [Custom Parameters](#age-plus-group) above, 
age-class 8 **is not** an age-plus group. 






**R0**: Initial number of unfished recruits to age-0. This number is used to scale the size of the population to match catch or data, but does not affect any of the population dynamics unless the OM has been conditioned with data. As a result, for a data-limited fishery any number can be used for R0 . In data-rich stocks R0 may be estimated as part of a stock assessment, but for data limited stocks users can choose either an arbitrary number (say, 1000) or choose a number that produces simulated catches in recent historical years that are similar to real world catch data. Single value. Positive real number.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1</span>



Adopting same value as the mean recruitment assumed in krill assessment under GRYM. 






**M**: The instantaneous rate of natural mortality. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.6, 1.26</span>



Simulation values for `M` provided in cpars (see [Custom 
Parameters](#custom-parameters)). The text above about `M` being drawn from an 
uniform distribution should be ignored. 






**Msd**: Inter-annual variation in M expressed as a coefficient of variation of a log-normal distribution. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter is positive, yearly M is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean specified by log(M) drawn for that simulation and a standard deviation in log space specified by the value of Msd drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Similarly to Krill's GRYM application, assuming natural mortality is constant 
over time. 






```{r, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
input <- file.path(system.file(package = 'MSEtool'),'Rmd/Stock/NaturalMortality.Rmd')
 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

### Recruitment: h, SRrel, Perr, AC

**h**: Steepness of the stock recruit relationship. Steepness governs the proportion of unfished recruits produced when the stock is at 20% of the unfished population size. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years of a given simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Values from 1/5 to 1.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1, 1</span>



Studies have failed to show a strong correlation between spawning biomass and 
subsequent recruitment in krill populations (Siegel and Loeb, 1995; Kinzey et 
al., 2019). This is mainly due to large inter-annual variability in biomass of 
spawners and recruits, which are thought to be strongly driven by environmental 
factors. 


GRYM projections do not account for stock-recruitment relationships, instead 
simulating annual recruitment by sampling from a probability distribution with mean and 
variance estimated from recruitment levels observed in acoustic surveys (check 
Section [Annual Recruitment](#annual-recruitment) for more details). 


`{openMSE}` does not offer the option to simulate recruits from a user-defined 
sampling distribution. Instead, mean recruitments $\mu_R$ are calculated from a 
stock-recruitment relationship defined by steepness `h`, which are in turn used 
to generate annual numbers of recruits $R_y$ from recruitment deviations $d_R$ 
following a lognormal process error, i.e. (?): 


$$R_y = \mu_R \times d_R,  d_R \sim logN \left( -\frac{\texttt{Perr}^2}{2}, \texttt{Perr}^2 \right)$$ 
if correlation in recruitments between consecutive years is ignored. 


Thus, fixing `h = 1` (i.e. forcing stock-recruitment independence) and using the 
recruitment variance estimates from PR as `Perr` inputs should provide a good 
approximation of  `{openMSE}` to GRYM in terms of recruitment simulation.  


Note: assuming `h = 1` implies high resilience of the population to 
strong harvesting, presenting a high probability of rebuilding when fishing 
pressure is relaxed even at low stock sizes. 






**SRrel**: Type of stock-recruit relationship. Use 1 to select a Beverton Holt relationship, 2 to select a Ricker relationship. Single value. Integer

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1</span>



Beverton–Holt model, to force stock-recruitment independence for `h = 1`. The Ricker 
model imposes a density dependence in the stock-recruitment process regardless 
of the value `h`. 






**Perr**: Recruitment process error, which is defined as the standard deviation of the recruitment deviations in log space. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.27, 1.15</span>



Simulation values for `Perr` provided in cpars (see [Custom 
Parameters](#custom-parameters)). The text above about values being drawn from 
an uniform distribution should be ignored. 






**AC**: Autocorrelation in the recruitment deviations in log space. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided, and used to add lag-1 auto-correlation to the log recruitment deviations. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Assuming no autocorrelation between consecutive annual recruitments, i.e. 
following the same approach as Krill's GRYM base case. 






```{r, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
input <- file.path(system.file(package = 'MSEtool'),'Rmd/Stock/Recruitment.Rmd')
 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

### Growth: Linf, K, t0, LenCV, Ksd, Linfsd

**Linf**: The von Bertalanffy growth parameter Linf, which specifies the average maximum size that would reached by adult fish if they lived indefinitely. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless Linfsd is a positive number. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 60, 60</span>



$L_\infty$ parameter assumed as known (i.e. no uncertainty), as in GRYM. Same 
$L_\infty$ value (mm) as used in Maschette et al. (2021) analysis, which cite 
Constable and de la Mare (1996). 






**K**: The von Bertalanffy growth parameter k, which specifies the average rate of growth. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless Ksd is a positive number. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.48, 0.48</span>



Growth parameter $K$ assumed as known (i.e. no uncertainty), as in GRYM. Same 
$K$ as used in Maschette et al. (2021) analysis, which cite Thanassekos et al 
(2021). 






**t0**: The von Bertalanffy growth parameter t0, which specifies the theoretical age at a size 0. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Age at size-0 assumed as known (i.e. no uncertainty), as in GRYM. Same parameter 
value as used in Maschette et al. (2021) analysis, which cite Thanassekos et al 
(2021). 






**LenCV**: The coefficient of variation (defined as the standard deviation divided by mean) of the length-at-age. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided to specify the distribution of observed length-at-age, and the CV of this distribution is constant for all age classes (i.e, standard deviation increases proportionally with the mean). Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.01, 0.01</span>



Assuming low variation in length-at-age - see Section [Length-at-age 
distribution](#length-at-age-distribution) above. Also, variation in 
length-at-age treated as known (i.e. no uncertainty and hence fixed across 
simulations). 






**Ksd**: Inter-annual variation in K. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter has a positive value, yearly K is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean specified by the value of K drawn for that simulation and a standard deviation (in log space) specified by the value of Ksd drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



As in GRYM, assuming no inter-annual variation in in growth parameter $K$.  






**Linfsd**: Inter-annual variation in Linf. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter has a positive value, yearly Linf is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a mean specified by the value of Linf drawn for that simulation and a standard deviation (in log space) specified by the value of Linfsd drawn for that simulation. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



As in GRYM, assuming no inter-annual variation in $L_\infty$. 






```{r, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
input <- file.path(system.file(package = 'MSEtool'),'Rmd/Stock/Growth.Rmd')
 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

### Maturity: L50, L50_95

**L50**: Length at 50% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 32, 37</span>



Same values as Min and Max length (mm) at 50% maturity used in Maschette et al. 
(2021) analysis - specifically the 'initial values' used for size at maturity. 






**L50_95**: Difference in lengths between 50% and 95% maturity. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. The value drawn is then added to the length at 50% maturity to determine the length at 95% maturity. This parameterization is used instead of specifying the size at 95 percent maturity to avoid situations where the value drawn for the size at 95% maturity is smaller than that at 50% maturity. The L50 and L50_95 parameters are converted to ages using the growth parameters provided and used to construct a logistic curve to determine the proportion of the population that is mature in each age class. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 2.7, 2.7</span>



GRYM formulates size-at-maturity using the ogive ramp function specified in terms 
`L50` and the ramp's width `w` (i.e. the range at which maturity occurs).  


Thus, `L95` (length at which 95% of individuals are matures) can be derived via 
the quantile function of the uniform distribution with limits `L50 +- w/2`. For 
a (known) width of 6mm, used as 'initial value' in Maschette et al (2021), we get the 
required `L50_95` parameter value. 


```{r} 
w <- 6 
L50 <- 35 # arbitrary as `w` is treated as independent of L50 in Maschette et al (2021) 
L95 <- qunif(0.95, L50 - w/2, L50 + w/2) 
L95 - L50  
``` 
Similarly to GRYM, where `w` is treated as known, `L50_95` is also kept fixed 
across simulations. 






```{r, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
input <- file.path(system.file(package = 'MSEtool'),'Rmd/Stock/Maturity.Rmd')
 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

### Stock depletion and Discard Mortality: D, Fdisc

**D**: Estimated current level of stock depletion, which is defined as the current spawning stock biomass divided by the unfished spawning stock biomass. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter is used during model initialization to select a series of yearly historical recruitment values and fishing mortality rates that, based on the information provided, could have resulted in the specified depletion level in the simulated last historical year. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers (typically < 1)

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 2, 3</span>



Range of values indicating growing population, i.e. making SSB in the last 
historical year to be higher than SSB0. Given that we are imposing absence of 
fishing mortality in historical period via the parameters `EffLower` and 
`EffUpper`, values assigned to parameter `D` should be irrelevant in terms of 
depletion due to fishing. In this case, and for a given level of constant 
natural mortality, depletion level is simply reflecting changes in biomass due 
to variability in annual recruitment. 


*Note 1*: Trial runs tested setting up an unexploited historical period via the `cpars` 
option, by providing a 0-filled matrix `cpars$Find`. `cpars$qs` values were also 
provided to skip the depletion optimization process. Unfortunately, and for no 
clear reason, MSE simulations crashed at the projection phase. 


*Note 2*: Ideally it would be desirable to set the length of the historical period 
to zero, but that also does not seem possible under the current `{openMSE}` 
version. See more details in section [Historical period](#historical-period) above. 








**Fdisc**: The instantaneous discard mortality rate the stock experiences when fished using the gear type specified in the corresponding fleet object and discarded. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Non-negative real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1, 1</span>



Arbitrary values, as discards are assumed non-existent, similarly to GRYM. 








```{r, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
input <- file.path(system.file(package = 'MSEtool'),'Rmd/Stock/Depletion.Rmd')
 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

### Length-weight conversion parameters: a, b

**a**: The alpha parameter in allometric length-weight relationship. Single value. Weight parameters are used to determine catch-at-age and population-at-age from the number of individuals in each age class and the length of each individual, which is drawn from a normal distribution determined by the Linf , K , t0 , and LenCV parameters. As a result, they function as a way to scale between numbers at age and biomass, and are not stochastic parameters. Single value. Positive real number.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0</span>



Same estimate as that specified in Maschette et al. (2021) for the 'initial' 
weight-at-length relationship (via the power law, W = a * Lb). Note: units of 
weight and length are, respectively, grams and millimeters. 






**b**: The beta parameter in allometric length-weight relationship. Single value. Weight parameters are used to determine catch-at-age and population-at-age from the number of individuals in each age class and the length of each individual, which is drawn from a normal distribution determine by the Linf , K , t0 , and LenCV parameters. As a result, they function as a way to scale between numbers at age and biomass, and are not stochastic parameters. Single value. Positive real number.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 3.31</span>



Same estimate as that specified in Maschette et al. (2021) for the 'initial' 
weight-at-length relationship.  








### Spatial distribution and movement: Size_area_1, Frac_area_1, Prob_staying

**Size_area_1**: The size of area 1 relative to area 2. The fraction of the unfished biomass in area 1. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, if Size_area_1 is 0.2, then 20% of the total area is allocated to area 1. Fishing can occur in both areas, or can be turned off in one area to simulate the effects of a no take marine reserve. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.5, 0.5</span>



Parameter value not allowed to be 1 (i.e. forcing one single area), so defining two 
sub-areas of equal size. 






**Frac_area_1**: The fraction of the unfished biomass in area 1. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, if Frac_area_1 is 0.5, then 50% of the unfished biomass is allocated to area 1, regardless of the size of area 1 (i.e, size and fraction in each area determine the density of fish, which may impact fishing spatial targeting). In each time step recruits are allocated to each area based on the proportion specified in Frac_area_1. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive real numbers.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.5, 0.5</span>



Parameter value not allowed to be 1 (i.e. forcing whole population in a single 
area), so specifying that population is evenly split between the two sub-areas. 






**Prob_staying**: The probability of individuals in area 1 remaining in area 1 over the course of one year. Please specify numbers between 0 and 1. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. For example, in an area with a Prob_staying value of 0.95 each fish has a 95% probability of staying in that area in each time step, and a 5% probability of moving to the other area. Uniform distribution lower and upper bounds. Positive fraction.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0.5, 0.5</span>



Assuming 50/50 chance of movement between sub-areas. 










```{r, echo=FALSE,include=FALSE}
input <- file.path(system.file(package = 'MSEtool'),'Rmd/Stock/Spatial.Rmd')
 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

# Fleet Parameters 

### Historical years of fishing, spatial targeting: nyears, Spat_targ

**nyears**: The number of years for the historical simulation. Single value. For example, if the simulated population is assumed to be unfished in 1975 and this is the year you want to start your historical simulations, and the most recent year for which there is data available is 2019, then nyears equals 45.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 5</span>



Minimum allowed number of years for historical period. See more details in section 
[Historical period](#historical-period) above. 




**Spat_targ**: Distribution of fishing in relation to vulnerable biomass (VB) across areas. The distribution of fishing effort is proportional to VB^Spat_targ. Upper and lower bounds of a uniform distribution. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter allows the user to model either avoidance or spatial targeting behavior by the fleet. If the parameter value is 1, fishing effort is allocated across areas in proportion to the population density of that area. Values below 1 simulate an avoidance behavior and values above 1 simulate a targeting behavior.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1, 1</span>



Assuming effort is distributed in proportion to the population density. 






### Trend in historical fishing effort (exploitation rate), interannual variability in fishing effort: EffYears, EffLower, EffUpper, Esd

**EffYears**: Vector indicating the historical years where there is information available to infer the relative fishing effort expended.This vector is specified in terms of the position of the year in the vector rather than the calendar year. For example, say our simulation starts with an unfished stock in 1975,and the current year (the last year for which there is data available) is 2019. Then there are 45 historical years simulated, and EffYears should include numbers between 1 and 45. Note that there may not be information available for every historical year, especially for data poor fisheries. In these situations, the EffYears vector should include only the positions of the years for which there is information, and the vector may be shorter than the total number of simulated historical years (nyears).



Arbitrary value - simulation requires at least one value to be provided, 
otherwise it crashes. Effort in the provided year will be null. 




**EffLower**: Lower bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to EffYears. EffLower must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the maximum number provided).



Population assumed to remain unexploited during the historical period. 






**EffUpper**: Upper bound on relative fishing effort corresponding to EffYears. EffUpper must be a vector that is the same length as EffYears describing how fishing effort has changed over time. Information on relative fishing effort can be entered in any units provided they are consistent across the entire vector because the data provided will be scaled to 1 (divided by the maximum number provided).



Population assumed to remain unexploited during the historical period.

.table {
    width: 75%; 
}
</style>
```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(Effvals, format='markdown', caption='')
```

**Esd**: Additional inter-annual variability in fishing mortality rate. For each historical simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. If this parameter has a positive (non-zero) value, the yearly fishing mortality rate is drawn from a log-normal distribution with a standard deviation (in log space) specified by the value of Esd drawn for that simulation. This parameter applies only to historical projections.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Population assumed to remain unexploited during the historical period, so 
variability in historical fishing mortality is ignored.

 out <- knitr::knit_child(input) 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat(out)
```

### Annual increase in catchability, interannual variability in catchability: qinc, qcv

**qinc**: Mean temporal trend in catchability (also though of as the efficiency of fishing gear) parameter, expressed as a percentage change in catchability (q) per year. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. Positive numbers indicate an increase and negative numbers indicate a decrease. q then changes by this amount for in each year of the simulation This parameter applies only to forward projections.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Analogously to GRYM, assuming no change in gear efficiency over the projection years. 






**qcv**: Inter-annual variability in catchability expressed as a coefficient of variation. For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This parameter applies only to forward projections.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Analogously to GRYM, assuming constant gear catchability over the projection years.

 out <- knitr::knit_child(input)

### Fishery gear length selectivity: L5, LFS, Vmaxlen, isRel

**L5**: Shortest length at which 5% of the population is vulnerable to selection by the gear used in this fleet. Values can either be specified as lengths (in the same units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the stock object) or as a percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter isRel for more information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying selection.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 25.05, 30.05</span>



Similarly to the maturity ogive, gear selectivity in `{GRYM}` is specified via a 
ramp function defined by two parameters: (i) `L50`, the length at which there is 50% 
retention probability for a given individual; and (ii) `SR`, the selection range. 


Minimum and maximum values of `L50` and `SR` from Thanassekos et al (2021, *in* 
Maschette et al., 2021), which are used to derive min and max values of `L5` via 
the quantile function. 


```{r} 
SR <- 11 
L50 <- c(30, 35) 
L5 <- qunif(0.05, L50 - SR/2, L50 + SR/2) 
L5 
``` 




**LFS**: Shortest length at which 100% of the population is vulnerable to selection by the gear used by this fleet. Values can either be specified as lengths (in the same units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the stock object) or as a percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter isRel for more information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying selection.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 35.5, 40.5</span>



Values derived from `L50` and `SR` from Thanassekos et al (2021), as above. 


```{r} 
L50 + SR/2 
``` 






**Vmaxlen**: Proportion of fish selected by the gear at the asymptotic length ('Stock@Linf'). Upper and Lower bounds between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that 100% of fish are selected at the asymptotic length, and the selection curve is logistic. If Vmaxlen is less than 1 the selection curve is dome shaped. For example, if Vmaxlen is 0.4, then only 40% of fish are vulnerable to the fishing gear at the asymptotic length.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1, 1</span>



All individuals considered to be selected at $L_{\infty}$, i.e. selectivity 
assumed to be logistic. 




**isRel**: Specify whether selection and retention parameters use absolute lengths or relative to the size of maturity. Single logical value (TRUE or FALSE).

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> FALSE</span>



Selectivity parameters are in absolute units. 






### Fishery length retention: LR5, LFR, Rmaxlen, DR

**LR5**: Shortest length at which 5% of the population is vulnerable to retention by the fleet. Values can either be specified as lengths (in the same units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the stock object) or as a percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter isRel for more information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying selection.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Analogously to GRYM, assuming no discards - i.e. all individuals selected by the 
gear are retained. 








**LFR**: Shortest length where 100% of the population is vulnerable to retention by the fleet. Values can either be specified as lengths (in the same units used for the maturity and growth parameters in the stock object) or as a percentage of the size of maturity (see the parameter isRel for more information). For each simulation a single value is drawn from a uniform distribution specified by the upper and lower bounds provided. This value is the same in all years unless cpars is used to provide time-varying selection.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Analogously to GRYM, assuming no discards - i.e. all individuals selected by the 
gear are retained. 






**Rmaxlen**: Proportion of fish retained at the asymptotic length ('Stock@Linf'). Upper and Lower bounds between 0 and 1. A value of 1 indicates that 100% of fish are retained at the asymptotic length, and the selection curve is logistic. If Rmaxlen is less than 1 the retention curve is dome shaped. For example, if Rmaxlen is 0.4, then only 40% of fish at the asymptotic length are retained.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 1, 1</span>



Same as `Vmaxlen`, i.e. 100% of fish are retained at $L_{\infty}$. 






**DR**: Discard rate, defined as the proportion of fully selected fish that are discarded by the fleet.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 0, 0</span>



Assuming no discards.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> 2022</span>

Final year with available data. 






### Existing Spatial Closures: MPA

**MPA**: Logical argument (TRUE or FALSE). Creates an MPA in Area 1 for all years if true is selected. Defaults to FALSE.

Specified Value(s): <span style='color:blue'> FALSE</span>



Stock assumed to be constrained to one single area.
