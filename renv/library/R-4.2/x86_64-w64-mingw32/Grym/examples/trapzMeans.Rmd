## meanTrapz 

The `meanTrapz` computes averages over a time interval, but if the
interval consists of a single point the value at that point is
returned.

Consider the expected value
\[
\frac{\int_{1}^{x} 2 x dx}{x-1} =
\begin{cases}
  x+1 & x \neq 1\\
  0 & x=1
\end{cases}
\]

For an interval `trapzMean` computes averages with the trapezoidal rule
```{r}
## The average of 2*x from 1 to 5
x <- 1:5
trapzMeans(fs=2*x)
trapz(fs=2*x, h=1)/4
```

But if the interval is a single point, the value of the function at
that point is returned.
```{r}
## For a single point return the function value
x <- 1
trapzMeans(fs=2*x)
```

For a matrix argument, these functions operate column by column
```{r}
## Average of cos(x), sin(x) from 0 to 2 pi
h <- 2*pi/100
x <- seq(from=0, to=2*pi, by=h)
cs <- cbind(cos(x), sin(x))
trapzMeans(fs=cs)
```
