## powerLW

The GYM uses a simple power law model
\[
W = a L^b
\]
to map lengths to weights.

The `powerLW` function implements the power law model as parameterized
in the GYM
```{r}
len <- seq(from=150, to=450, by=50)

## Convert length to weight
wgt <- powerLW(L=len, a=9.0E-10, b=3.32)
wgt
```

and `powerWL` is the inverse mapping
```{r}
## Convert weigth to length
len <- powerWL(W=wgt, a=9.0E-10, b=3.32)
len
```

#### Weight at age

Define age classes and within year time steps
```{r}
## Daily time steps and 7 age classes
nsteps <- 365
Ages <- 2:8
Days <- seq(from=0, to=1, length=nsteps+1)
h <- 1/nsteps
```

Create a matrix of the age at each time step of each age class
```{r}
## Ages
ages <- outer(X=Days, Y=Ages, FUN="+")
```

Use a von Bertalanffy length at age relationship to create a matrix of
the length at each time step of each age class
```{r}
## Age-length conversion
ls <- vonBertalanffyAL(A=ages, t0=0.0667, K=0.5, Linf=500)
```

and a power law weight-length relationship to create a matrix of the
weight at each time step of each age class
```{r}
## Length-weight conversion
ws <- powerLW(L=ls, a=9E-10, b=3.32)
matplot(x=Days, y=ws, type="l",lty=1,xlab="Day",ylab="Weight",main="Weight at Age")
```
