## surveyAdjustGYM

The `surveySurival` function adjusts surveyed age class abundances to
initial abundances at a reference age class as implemented in the GYM.
Where abundance is estimated from multiple surveys,  abundance is
estimated as a geometric mean of the estimates from individual surveys
weighted by the inverse of the squared *coefficient of variation* of
the surveyed density.

#### Setup

Define age classes and within year time steps
```{r}
## Daily time steps and 7 age classes
nsteps <- 365
Ages <- 2:8
Days <- seq(from=0, to=1, length=nsteps+1)
h <- 1/nsteps
```

Define the intra-annual natural mortality and its integral
```{r}
## Constant intra-annual natural mortality
ms <- matrix(data=1, nrow=nsteps+1, ncol=length(Ages))
ms <- ms/mean(x=trapz(fs=ms, h=h))
Ms <- ctrapz(fs=ms, h=h)
```

Suppose surveys are conducted in years 3,  4 and 5,  starting on time
step 190 in year 1,  time step 220 in year 2 and time step 150 in year
3,  and in each case the survey lasted 12 days and all age classes were
surveyed.
```{r}
## Survey year,  period and age classes
svy <- data.frame(yr=3:5, s1=c(190, 220, 150), s2=c(201, 231, 161))
svy <- cbind(svy[rep(1:3, each=7), ], cls=1:7)
head(svy)
```


#### Constant mortality

Assume there is no inter-annual variability in natural mortality and
the annual scalings of natural mortality is constant
```{r}
## Constant mortality
M <- 0.2
```

Convert surveyed age to the modelled age class
```{r}
## Convert age to age class
survey.df$AgeClass <- survey.df$Age-min(Ages)+1
```

Estimate the abundance of the first age class
```{r}
## Adjust survey abundances to abundance of reference age class
surveyAdjustGYM(survey.df=survey.df, Ms=Ms, M=M, rcls=1)
```


#### Variable mortality

When there is inter-annual variability in natural mortality
```{r}
## Variable mortality (22 years between 0.2 & 0.201)
M <- runif(n=22, min=0.2, max=0.201)
```

The labelling of survey years (`Year`) must corresponds to the elements of
`M` (so `Year==1` corresponds to `M[1]`)
```{r}
## M[1] must correspond to Year==1
survey.df$Year0 <- survey.df$Year
survey.df$Year <- survey.df$Year0-1983
```

Estimate the abundance of the first age class
```{r}
## Adjust survey abundances to abundance of reference age class
rec.df <- surveyAdjustGYM(survey.df=survey.df, Ms=Ms, M=M, rcls=1)
rec.df$Year <- rec.df$Year+1983
rec.df
```

Abundance cannot be estimated for cohorts that must be projected
outside the time interval spanned by `M`
```{r}
survey.df$Year <- survey.df$Year0-1985
## Adjust survey abundances to abundance of reference age class
rec.df <- surveyAdjustGYM(survey.df=survey.df, Ms=Ms, M=M, rcls=1)
rec.df$Year <- rec.df$Year+1985
rec.df
```
