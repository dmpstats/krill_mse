## surveySurvival

The `surveySurvival` function computes the total survival of a cohort
from time of recruitment to a nominated survey period given specified
natural and fishing mortalities.  The resulting survivals can be used
to backproject age based abundance survey data to estimate
recruitment.

#### Setup

Define age classes and within year time steps
```{r}
## Daily time steps and 7 age classes
nsteps <- 365
Ages <- 2:8
Days <- seq(from=0, to=1, length=nsteps+1)
h <- 1/nsteps
```

Define the intra-annual natural mortality and its integral
```{r}
## Constant intra-annual natural mortality
ms <- matrix(data=1, nrow=nsteps+1, ncol=length(x=Ages))
ms <- ms/mean(x=trapz(fs=ms, h=h))
Ms <- ctrapz(fs=ms, h=h)
```

Suppose surveys are conducted in years 3,  4 and 5,  starting on time
step 190 in year 1,  time step 220 in year 2 and time step 150 in year
3,  and in each case the survey lasted 12 days and all age classes were
surveyed.
```{r}
## Survey year,  period and age classes
svy <- data.frame(yr=3:5, s1=c(190, 220, 150), s2=c(201, 231, 161))
svy <- cbind(svy[rep(x=1:3, each=7), ], cls=1:7)
head(svy)
```


#### Constant mortality

Assume there is no inter-annual variability in natural mortality and
the annual scalings of natural mortality is constant
```{r}
## Constant mortality
M <- 0.2
```

The total mean survival for the cohort from the start of the year in
which they were in the first age class to the survey period is
```{r}
## Survival to the survey period from age class 1
surveySurvival(yr=svy$yr, cls=svy$cls, s1=svy$s1, s2=svy$s2, Ms=Ms, M=M)
```

The computed survivals can be used to project cohort abundances the
initial abundance for the first age class.

To compute the mean survival for the cohort from the start of the year
in which they were in the third age class o the survey period
```{r}
## Survival to the survey period from age class 3
surveySurvival(yr=svy$yr, cls=svy$cls, s1=svy$s1, s2=svy$s2, Ms=Ms, M=M, rcls=3)
```
For age classes younger than third age class at the time of survey the
surival is greater than 1.


#### Variable mortality

When there is inter-annual variability in natural mortality
```{r}
## Variable mortality
M <- rgamma(n=10, shape=20, rate=100)
M
```

the labelling of survey years (`yr`) corresponds to the elements of
`M` (so `yr==1` corresponds to `M[1]`) and survival cannot be
estimated for cohorts that must be projected outside the time interval
spanned by `M`.
```{r}
## Survival cannot be projected outside the period for which mortality
## is specified.
surveySurvival(yr=svy$yr, cls=svy$cls, s1=svy$s1, s2=svy$s2, Ms=Ms, M=M)
```
