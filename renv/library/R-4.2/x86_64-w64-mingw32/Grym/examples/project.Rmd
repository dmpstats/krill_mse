## project 

The `project` function projects abundance, biomass and yield by age
class forward over one year when natural and fishing mortalities are
known.

#### Setup

Define age classes and within year time steps
```{r}
## Daily time steps and 7 age classes
nsteps <- 365
Ages <- 2:8
Days <- seq(from=0, to=1, length=nsteps+1)
h <- 1/nsteps
```

Create matrices of age, length and weight for each time step and age class
```{r}
## Ages
ages <- outer(X=Days, Y=Ages, FUN="+")
## Age-length and length-weight conversions
ls <- vonBertalanffyAL(A=ages, t0=0.0667, K=0.5, Linf=500)
ws <- powerLW(L=ls, a=9E-10, b=3.32)
```

Define the normalized intra-annual natural mortality, its integral and the annual scaling
```{r}
## Constant intra-annual natural mortality
ms <- matrix(data=1, nrow=nsteps+1, ncol=length(x=Ages))
ms <- ms/mean(x=trapz(fs=ms, h=h))
Ms <- ctrapz(fs=ms, h=h)
Msf <- final(P=Ms)
M <- 0.1
```


Create the vector of within year distribution of fishing effort,
assuming fishing occurs on days 80 to 119, and define a length based
selectivity
```{r}
## Normalized within year distribution of fishing effort
fwy <- double(length=nsteps+1)
fwy[81:220] <- 1
fwy <- fwy/trapz(fs=fwy, h=h)
## Length based selectivity
ss <- rampOgive(x=ls, x50=420, xrange=30)
```

Define the normalized intra-annual fishing mortality, its integral and
the annual scaling.
```{r}
## Intra-annual fishing mortality - effort by selectivity
fs <- fwy*ss
Fs <- ctrapz(fs=fs, h=h)
Fsf <- final(P=Fs)
F <- 0.2
```

#### Projection from equilibrium 

Project forward one year from an equilibrium age structure.

Compute an intial age structure assuming constant mortalities and
assuming no plus class
```{r}
## Deterministic initial age structure
N0 <- ageStructureD(MMsf=M*Msf, FFsf=F*Fsf)
N0
```

Project forward for a single year with known mortalities
```{r}
## Annual projection from N0
pr <- project(ws=ws, MMs=M*Ms, FFs=F*Fs, Ffs=F*fs, Nref=N0, yield=2)
```

Examine the final abundance and total yield 
```{r}
## Final abundance
pr$N[nsteps+1,]
## Total annual yield
sum(pr$Y[nsteps+1,])
```

Plot the initial age structure and resulting profiles of abundance,
biomass and yield by age class
```{r,fig.show="hold"}
## Plot initial abundance, projected abundance, biomass and yield
opar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(5,4,2,2)+0.1)
pal <- hcl(h=seq(from=15, to=375, length=8)[1:7], l=65, c=100)
plot(x=Ages, y=N0, xlab="Age", ylab="Abundance")
matplot(x=Days, y=pr$N, xlab="Day", ylab="Abundance", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
matplot(x=Days, y=pr$B, xlab="Day", ylab="Biomass", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
matplot(x=Days, y=pr$Y, xlab="Day", ylab="Yield", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
par(opar)
```

#### Projection from survey

Project forward one year, matching given average relative abundance and
total biomass over a set of reference time steps obtained from a survey
```{r}
## Annual projection given relative abundance and total
## biomass estimated from a five day mid-year survey (days 150 to 154)
Nsurvey <- c(1.0,0.67,0.46,0.33,0.25,0.18,0.13) 
Bsurvey <- 15000 
pr <- project(ws=ws, MMs=M*Ms, FFs=F*Fs, Ffs=F*fs, Nref=Nsurvey, 
              nref=151:155, Bref=Bsurvey, yield=2)
```

Examine the total annual yield
```{r}
## Total annual yield
sum(pr$Y[nsteps+1,])
```

Plot the initial age structure and resulting profiles of abundance,
biomass and yield by age class
```{r,fig.show="hold"}
## Plot initial abundance, projected abundance, biomass and yield
opar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(5,4,2,2)+0.1)
pal <- hcl(h=seq(from=15, to=375, length=8)[1:7],l=65,c=100)
plot(x=Ages, y=pr$N[1,], xlab="Age", ylab="Abundance")
matplot(x=Days, y=pr$N, xlab="Day", ylab="Abundance", type="l" ,lty=1, col=pal)
matplot(x=Days, y=pr$B, xlab="Day", ylab="Biomass", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
matplot(x=Days, y=pr$Y, xlab="Day", ylab="Yield", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
par(opar)
```

#### Multi-year projection

Project forward 10 years from a virgin stock assuming constant fishing
mortality, collating annual abundance, biomass and yield.

Create matrices to store annual projections
```{r}
## Ten year projection from virgin stock collating final annual
## abundance, biomass and yield
Years <- 1:10
Nf <- Bf <- Yf <- matrix(data=NA, nrow=length(Years), ncol= length(Ages))
```


Compute an equilibrium age structure assuming constant natural mortality
and no fishing, assuming no plus class and 8000 recruits per year.
```{r}
## Deterministic initial age structure assuming no fishing and 8000
## new recruits each year
N0 <- ageStructureD(MMsf=M*Msf, R=8000)
```

For each year, project forward from the initial abundance assuming
constant fishing mortality, update the the initial abundance for the
next projection assuming 8000 new recruits, and record the final
abundance, biomass and yield from the projection
```{r}
## Project forward with constant fishing mortality
for(k in 1:nrow(x=Nf)) {
  pr <- project(ws=ws, MMs=M*Ms, FFs=F*Fs, Ffs=F*fs, Nref=N0, yield=1)
  N0 <- advance(N=pr$N, R=8000)
  Nf[k,] <- final(P=pr$N)
  Bf[k,] <- final(P=pr$B)
  Yf[k,] <- pr$Y
}
```

Plot final abundance, biomass and yield for each year by age class
```{r,fig.show="hold"}
## Plot annual abundance, biomass and yield
opar <- par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(5,4,2,2)+0.1)
pal <- hcl(h=seq(from=15, to=375, length=8)[1:7], l=65, c=100)
matplot(x=Years, y=Nf, xlab="Year", ylab="Abundance", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
matplot(x=Years, y=Bf, xlab="Year", ylab="Biomass", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
matplot(x=Years, y=Yf, xlab="Year", ylab="Yield", type="l", lty=1, col=pal)
par(opar) 
```
