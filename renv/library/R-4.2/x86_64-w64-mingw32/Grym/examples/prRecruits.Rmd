## prRecruits

Grym offers several variants of the proportional recruitment model
implemented in the GYM.

Let \(A_{k}\) be the number of individuals in age class \(k\) and define
\[
R = \frac{A_{r}}{\sum_{k=r} A_{k}}
\]
the number of individuals in age class \(r\) as a proportion of all
individuals of that age or older.  Given estimates of the mean and
variance of \(R\) from independent surveys, the proportional
recruitment model determines the scaling of natural mortality M and
the distribution of random recruits that will reproduce the observed
mean and variance of R.

#### Setup

Define age classes and within year time steps
```{r}
## Daily time steps and 7 age classes
nsteps <- 365
Ages <- 2:8
Days <- seq(from=0, to=1, length=nsteps+1)
h <- 1/nsteps
```

Create matrices of age, length and weight for each time step and age class
```{r}
## Ages
ages <- outer(X=Days, Y=Ages, FUN="+")
## Age-length and length-weight conversions
ls <- vonBertalanffyAL(A=ages, t0=0.0667, K=0.5, Linf=500)
ws <- powerLW(L=ls, a=9E-10, b=3.32)
```

Define the intra-annual natural mortality, its integral and the annual scaling
```{r}
## Constant intra-annual natural mortality
ms <- matrix(data=1, nrow=nsteps+1, ncol=length(x=Ages))
ms <- ms/mean(x=trapz(fs=ms, h=h))
Ms <- ctrapz(fs=ms, h=h)
Msf <- final(P=Ms)
```

Let \(R\) be the proportion of the number of recruits as a fraction of the
total population.


#### Inverse Beta

Generate model parameters from the mean and variance of \(R\).  This
computes an estimate of the scaling of natural mortality required to
reproduce the observed \(R\).
```{r}
## Compute model parameters that give mean R = 0.3 and var R = 0.1, 
## where R is the proportion of recruits in the population
ps <- prRecruitParsIB(Msf=Msf, mnR=0.3, vrR=0.01)
## Estimated natural mortality scaling
ps$M
```

Compute the median number of recruits
```{r}
## Median number of recruits
prRecruitsQuantileIB(q=0.5, ps=ps, mnA=100)
```

Random numbers of recruits are generated from the estimated parameters
```{r}
## Ten random recruit numbers
prRecruitsIB(10, ps, mnA=100)
```

Check the random numbers of recruits have the required mean
```{r}
## Mean number of recruits
mean(x=prRecruitsIB(n=10000, ps=ps, mnA=100))
```

Simulate the 10000 stochastic age profiles with this distribution of
recruits and check the the observed mean and variance of \(R\) are reproduced
```{r}
## Simulate age profiles and calculate R
N <- matrix(data=0, nrow=10000, ncol=ncol(x=Ms))
for(k in 1:nrow(x=N))
  N[k, ] <- ageStructureS(R=prRecruitsIB(n=ncol(x=Ms), ps=ps, mnA=100), Msf=Msf, M=ps$M)
R <- N[, 1]/rowSums(x=N)
## Estimate mean and variance of R
mean(R)
var(R)
```

```{r}
## Histogram of simulated recruitments
rs <- prRecruitsIB(n=100000, ps=ps, mnA=100)
hist(x=rs[rs < 350], breaks=seq(from=0, to=350, by=5), freq=FALSE, 
     xlab="Recruits", main="Inverse Beta")
```

class 3 as a fraction of individuals of that age or older,
