## logisticOgive

Grym provides a logistic ogive to model both maturity or fishing selectivity.


The `logisticOgive` function implements a logistic ogive parameterized in
terms of the 50th and 95th percentiles
```{r}
x <- seq(from=150, to=450, by=10)
p <- logisticOgive(x, x50=300, x95=380)
plot(x=x, y=p, type="l")
```
