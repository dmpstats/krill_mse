<current management approach>
The Antarctic krill fishery in FAO Area 48 is currently managed based on
precautionary catch limits set by the The Commission for the Conservation of
Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR).

<openMSE>

<Goal>
This analysis aims to show how the tool `openMSE` can be applied to the Krill
fishery under a data-limited framework.

The analysis is structured in two parts:

   - Part 1: Approximate `openMSE` to the current management approach
   
   - Part 2: Apply an example MSE to Krill
